Level Creator:
The Level Creator is a game object within the scene responsible for generating new game levels. It receives specific parameters for a level, highlights the designated area with a green square to visually indicate where the level will be positioned, and upon clicking the "Create Level" button, it generates and saves the new level in the resources folder.
